### **Abstract**
This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It uses data that includes factors like blood glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin levels. The aim is to build accurate models for early detection of diabetes to assist in timely medical intervention. Two approaches were used: XGBoost (a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm) and a deep neural network. Both models were evaluated for their performance, and predictions were made for unseen samples to demonstrate practical application.

### **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identified and handled missing or zero values in important columns such as glucose, blood pressure, and insulin by replacing them with the average value of each column.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).
   - Scaled the features to ensure better performance of models.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - **XGBoost Model**: A machine learning algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. It was trained and evaluated for classification.
   - **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network with multiple layers was created. Dropout layers were added to prevent overfitting, and the network was trained using the Adam optimizer.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The models were tested on unseen data, and metrics such as accuracy and classification reports were generated to evaluate their performance.

4. **Unknown Predictions**:
   - A real-world example was provided, where input data for an unknown patient was passed through both models to predict if the individual had diabetes.

### **Conclusion**
Both models showed strong predictive abilities, demonstrating the potential of using machine learning and deep learning for diabetes prediction. The XGBoost model provided reliable accuracy and interpretability, while the deep learning model excelled in handling complex patterns in the data. These models can serve as useful tools for healthcare providers to predict diabetes and recommend timely preventive measures. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
